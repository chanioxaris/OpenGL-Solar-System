# OpenGL_SolarSystem

A simple solar system using OpenGL and Glut. 
The solar system includes a sun, 4 planets that rotating around him and some stars as the background.
I used an .obj file for the planets, from which i parse the data for the planet's shape.
With the key "Q" you can exit the program and with key "P" you can pause it.
Also with keys "W", "A", "S", "D" you can move the camera up, left, down and right accordingly.
